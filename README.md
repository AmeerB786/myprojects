This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, from the command prompt point to the backend project directory to run the backend service:

example - 

cd C://cryptoApp_v1/crypto_data_app_backend

then run below command

npm start

and after this check if the application is listening on port 5000

Second, from the command prompt point to the frontend project directory to run the ui service:

example - 

cd C://cryptoApp_v1/crypto_data_app_frontend

then run below command

npm run dev

and after this 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
